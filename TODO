* Fix bug where the server crashes if invalid result param is specified "result/whataeverwrong"
* Support authentication if repo is private
* Parallelize querying with regexp using go and wait before returning result for queries to finish
* If newly uploaded repo is already indexed, pull latest changes, and index new/modified files
* When searching for a repo in index pull latest changes and index it
 - Maybe have a timeout per repo to avoid overloading the server
* Option to search all repos
* A search option to specify a repo to upload and index + a search query
* Add Search options similar to cmd line flags
 - main function options from cindex and csearch
 - regexp.Grep() options
* Add filtering features (Predefined queries) + Inline Query filters
* Call IndexRepo concurrently and have a lock per repo when indexing or something better
* Project Files Explorer
* File reader with ability to highlight variables and functions:
 - When loading file in server identify all the keywords for vars and funcs
 - Add links that basically do a query on that keyword and return all relations
  - Relation types: Defenitions, Declerations, and References
 - Find common issues: secruity flaws, bugs, spelling mistakes, grammar?
 - When opening file go to line and highlight query result
